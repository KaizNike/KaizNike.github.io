                            Hi. Let's talk about two videos I saw lately plus more in AI. For some bonus fun, let's get up to speed on this year and happenings...
                                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QCcJtTBvSKk?si=u3rzB0O8_Bj8O_aR" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                            <p>
                                If I can summarize what I remember from those videos, Mark Zuckerburg is wondering where the AI curve ends and is looking less like an alien. According to <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-thirsty-data-centres-spring-up-in-water-poor-mexican-town/">other news I read (the globe and mail dot com) about Mexico.</a> These investments in computing are quick to flee the USA and create new Silicon Valleys wherein places that need money, but don't neccessarily have the resources to survive are.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h4>'new Silicon Valleys...' - The data must flow.</h4>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                            In this era, data is everywhere and every social security number of every citizen in the States, Canada, and the United Kingdoms has apparently been leaked. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/hackers-steal-billions-of-social-security-numbers-how-to-protect-yourself"><img src="assets/imgs/hackreport1.png" alt="Article by PC Mag, written by a somewhat Asian man: 'Michael Kan', below is some Social Security cards."></a> Travel through image above to see an article detailing the event in more detail. It is stunning.
                                <br>
                                I have brought up three topics, let's degauss it. The first is of twitter and art theft: According to digital trends: <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-grok/">"The model is trained on a mix of web data (with a knowledge cutoff of Q3 2023) and X user data. Currently, Grok the chatbot is powered by the Grok-2 model, which was released in August 2024."</a>, it speaks of their AI grok. I can't really 'grok' what the context is behind @urct's cry, whether the user generated the content on Grok or another platform... If it was generated by Grok, then there's evidence of it using users' art to generate content against their will and against their revenue stream. The post content of @urct's retweet was deleted before I could screenshot, so all I will leave is the @. We are quickly making ourselves obsolete.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h4>Planned Obsolesence - The cash must accumulate.</h4>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                We flought ourselves with high concept concepts like, "simulation theory", "flat earth theory", "theory of everything", "artificial general intelligence", to name some big ones I recall. All the while Earth remains a dangerous place to live and so many crises are visible on the daily. I want art to continue being a valuable path for people, as I would love to follow that path given time. I know I personally have trouble making money from my passions, a lot of my work that I put out is pretty tepid and uninteresting, I am unwilling to make a decent try of things and be let down. Be let down...
                                    <br>
                                    It is pretty scary that we are training these AI to replicate what we do and say, with knowledge of how imperfect we are, we are gods in this era. Our fathers and theirs shaped earth, land, and stone. We shape silicon. What ghosts do we leave as we die? A recent video on Youtube got me wondering that...

                                    What legacy do I leave? A support to my family, perhaps, but to the greater world, I was not a footnote, save for what I get to write myself. I made my shrine to my cats on my page, which is more than I'm used to doing to connect my public persona with my private life. Even like vtubers, tho I have posted a lot of details about myself, I keep track of what I say as Kaizar Nike. 
                            </p>
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                <p>I could stop talking at any point on this blog, but let's cover more of what's on my mind of late. Transgenderism is a wierd wyord. I keep getting disgusted by their scarred bodies, turned on by their genshin transformations, confused by their hatred, infatuated with their works. I keep Shinigami Eyes on me, a interesting plugin. I keep treating red names as problematic and green names as heroes, but then I see those green names saying vile things, and those red names I have trouble taking seriously, but sometimes wisdom pops uot.<br>Today: Nikocado Avocado, Natalie Lawman, Taylor McCue, Brianna Wu, Christian Chandler, these names do not all fit in the same circle of a venn diagram, but are people none the less. So much of our worlds revolve around the icons we see or hate each day.
                                Today, Nikocado makes a reveal. Yesterday, Brianna Wu speaks. A day before, Taylor makes a crude art of a teenish boy disgusted at a tran's wound of a sex part. Inbetween those times, Natalie freely exudes her history with the games press. At another point Chris gets out of prison for allegdly raping his mother. (Not willing to research that thanks.) These people live in another world to me, some closer than others. Yet it's still Earth; the planet.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h4>Summation - Respite for Weary Eyes</h4>
                                <p>Now that you're up to date with the past, let's talk future. I need cash, so I'm willing to try anything. There's ad space for sale now on this site, but *hint hint*, I won't let intrusive ads on. So what did we learn? What's next? I want to work on my RPG project, been lacking Steam for that. The AI debacle could go all the way to disaster, but I think people will lose money on it just like Crypto, Web-3 and the 3D + AR/VR/XR boom. The disaster I'm thinking of: AI getting outside it's sandbox, could be very terrible to online creatives as they find digital eye time being competed for with bots. Here's a vision from a Google before it's Monopoly hearing:
                                </p>

                                <br>
                                <p>Because I didn't upload this in time let's talk the debate. Kamala Harris won decisively in making me not want to vote for her or Trump. Global Warming was a foot note. Harris spoke of a two state Israel/Palestine, but who would accomplish such a deal? Trump offers peace and American strength, Harris offers unity and justice for all, "We are both gun owners, guns aren't going away," Harris said. Transgender and women would be better off under Harris, as Trump wants to leave women's rights to tyrannical states. Trump kept asking what Harris did during her term as vice president and calling them the worst pair to hold office in history of the USA.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h4>Global Warming, more like Global boring.</h4>
                                <p>Calling out my dad here, but he said they didn't make any real mistakes, they talked over each other a lot, and were fighting the hosts. Political drama, and people loved Harris's victory. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2024/09/10/trump-admits-he-has-no-answer-to-obamacare-but-concepts-of-a-plan/">internet (Forbes)</a> <a href="https://x.com/ZFDigiVagrant/status/1833699291099283496">is laughing (Twitter img).</a> 
                                    <br>
                                    I am now listening to a Twitter discussion on Spaces, one guy is confused about Roe v Wade. The topic is Trump's refusal to outright say he would veto a Republican led abortion ban. Now they are talking about how reliable the government is, I could keep typing, so I might.
                                <br>
                                    This space is a tragedy, this Colin Bull guy says girls know the day after if you're pregnant. Thank you guys for discussing women. This is cringe, the topic failed. The time is 11:18 PM Central US. Now they're talking Palestine. This Destin guy is talking about how Harris's anwsers failed for me tonight. John Spencer "@spencerguard", brings up the point that Trump spoke reality of Iran. Now jefe showed up talking shit of Destin. Man Destin is cringe, I love this - thank you for reading. This after debate party is real, they have spent 30 minutes laughing at their dumb discussion. I am watching Adrian try to teach jefe how to talk to people. 
                                <br>
                                    <p>I continue to listen to this, now Adrian is claiming a girl sucks out the blue part of tide pods first, and calls her retarted. What a wonderful guy, I love going to Elon's Twitter. Did you see his Taylor Swift baby making offer? Now back to the space, this Adrian guy has a unworldy fascination with autistic people. Now Michael has arrived at 12:10 with more substance, Harris's $50,000 small business grants. They are sprinkling in this conversation with bits of crypto and deregulation. Some discussion of past cantidates like Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders. Now they're talking of Elon Musk. At 12:48 they're looking at Elon's successes. They are arguing again. I like when the host argues with everybody. This Adrain guy could speak in Audible books. I LOVE MICHAEL BARBOUR! He got kicked and thus it ended.</p>

                                <p>Cohost is going away, I might backup parts of it to my site, including my better old posts.

							<h3>Teaching the Basics of 2D Array Games, Tilebased</h3>
							<p>2021 - October, 27: Everyone wants to make a roguelike, let me show you how to start in HTML, followed by Godot. == Under Construction ==<br>

							<ul class="actions">
								<li><button onclick="show_passage('2')">Learn!</button></li>
							</ul>
                            <p id="2" class="hidden">Hello! <code>#Let's get started, this section features code snippets!</code><br/>
                            So you want to make a roguelike? Or any other game that uses a 2D Array, lets get looking at one.<br/><code>var Array = [["player", 0, "kobold"],[0,0,"kobold"],["kobold",0,"ogre"]]</code> Yes that's a 2D array and that should work in both JavaScript and GDScript, my tools of choice. If arrays aren't in the language you're using, go ahead and implement them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming">You can learn from a source like Wikipedia if you have the dire need to develop your own iteration of the array.</a> So now that we have an array, feel free to copy that one, we need to get something on screen, I will show you in JavaScript first and then more generally.<br/> So let's review our goals, we need to cover "player", the number 0, "kobold", and even an "ogre". My task for you now is to get those assets ready, but if you want to be simple, use "@", "0", "k", and "O". Best to capitalize the ogre as it is strong. As for the @ symbol, well some programmer used to represent the player and we've been using it ever since.<br/>Now we need to display it, and I hope you have those assets ready and an IDE with HTML/CSS/JavaScript capability, cuz we're going in hot!<br/><textarea style="color: #e83e8c" readonly='true'>function drawMap() {
    for (var i = 0; i < mapArray.length; i++) {
                                        for (var j = 0; j < mapArray[i].length; j++) { 
                                // YOUR NEXT STEP 
                                }</textarea><br/>This will do the brute labor, it will iterate through the length of <code>mapArray</code> so set <code>Array</code> to be <code>mapArray</code> best not to be too generic! If you didn't know weHave a specialWay of naming variables, but you can really name it anything. I mean that! As long as what you choose doesn't cause errors that is! But that's basics.<br/>Next!<br/><br/><textarea style="color: #e83e8c" readonly='true'>if(mapArray[i][j] == 0) {
                $('#containerMap').append(tileGrass.advDetail);
            }</textarea> I hope you have tile grass, cuz 0 is next! I just threw some new curveballs at you. You need JQuery for this, it didn't work well without it for me. I included <code>tileGrass.advDetail</code> as a dictionary containing the term "advDetail" and that looks like this! <textarea style="color: #e83e8c" readonly="true">tilesMain = [
    tileGrass = {id: 0, name: "Grass", advDetail: '<div class="grass"></div>'}]</textarea> So we're using jQuery to append a class, but to what? Yes you need a div called <textarea style="color: #e83e8c" readonly='true'><div id="containerMap">
                <!-- example tile for testing purposes, containerMap should be empty when first loaded. -->
             <!--   <div class="grass"></div>   -->
            </div></textarea> Yes that's my comment there, if you've gotten this far, maybe you want to review my first major <a href="https://github.com/KaizNike/Beast-Kings/blob/master/Scripts/adventurescript.js">failed project.</a> If you click that, you agree to learn from my mistakes! Also copy this code over to your IDE to get a better typecasing, yes even this tutorial is under construction! You can uncomment that div to get the grass to display!

</html></textarea> Hope you got all that, now if that doesn't work bother @KaizarNike on Twitter. Now to get crazy! Let's, instead of implementing ECS, have two arrays! <code>mapArray=[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]] actorArray=[["player", 0, "kobold"],[0,0,"kobold"],["kobold",0,"ogre"]]</code>Hmm now how's it look? Nine squares in a row, we can do better. Add this to style. <code>#containerMap {
            height: 60px;
            width: 60px;
        }</code> So what have we done? We have nine boxes in a cube. Cool, time for dudes. I got stuck in dev hell, so look what I have wrought!<textarea style="color: #e83e8c" readonly="true"><!DOCTYPE html>

    Hi!
    <p>@</p>
    <!--
    <div class="grass"><p>@</p></div>
-->
    <div id="containerMap">
                <!-- example tile for testing purposes, containerMap should be empty when first loaded. -->
             <!--   <div class="grass"></div>   -->
        </div>
    </body>
</html></textarea>Now let's walk through the code step by step. We define the html and head tags first. (tags are Html's way of identifying things. We then import jQuery as a tool. Then we define the indoc styles we need. <code>.grass</code>,<code>.grass p</code>, and<code>#containerMap</code> These all allow the page to be styled properly to our liking. For some quick tips on the attributes <code>background-color</code> in grass turns it green. <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> in grass define the size of each tile, hope you kept those assets small! After the styling, we come across <code>mapArray</code> and <code>tilesMain</code> which store our needed data. I usually put stuff like that in a data.js that gets loaded first for housekeeping. mapArray is a 2D array, which means its nested. You have to go two levels deep to get the data out. The reason for <code>mapArray[i][j]</code> later in the code.
                            <br/>Whew. I'm tired. Lets keep going. We call <code>windows.onload = function(){drawMap()}</code> to get things started before the player sees. It calls drawMap, so let's talkl about it. drawMap is made of a nested for loop that allows you to access the nested array. Finally we used jQuery to append the data set in our tilesMan array, made of dictionaries.<br/><br/>
                            That's all for part two, stick around for Godot. But I hope you can use something from this web tutorial!</p>

                            <p id="1" class="hidden">Scalpers, insurrectionists, opioids out of control, pandemic, its been a good start to a year. 2020 was widely agreed to be the worst, so what did I do? Well I started the year with the yogscast game jam and made my first jam game, Abundance of Death. Who knew that the during the year we'd be losing so many? Maybe no one wants the gift of death this christmas, the game was supposed to be about giving for krissake. <br> I learned a lot during that jam. About tilesets, about animations, about platformers. I did a good job. I really love game jams and would like to do another.
                            <br> I started with nicehash this year with my 1060. Not seeing huge profits, but its nice to have bitcoin, but it could drop anytime - guess I'll sell. Want to make at least $50 before that. Messed around with my overclocking, but couldnt get it stable. Am fine with default for now. I dream of having a mining rig one day.</p>
